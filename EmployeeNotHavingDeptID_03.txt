1.
	Select * from EMPLOYEE
	Where deptid not in (Select deptid from DEPARTMENT)

2.

	Select e.* from EMPLOYEE e
	Left Join DEPARTMENT d ON e.deptid = d.deptid
	Where e.deptid not in (Select deptid from DEPARTMENT)

3.

	Select * from EMPLOYEE where deptid not in (1,2)


The 3 method I would least recommend to another developer.
